###Usage
There is only one argument you could give. `-d` or `--directory`. 
This is just a pathway to the directory that contains the files you wish to combine and bookmark. 
If you omit this argument, a GUI window will pop up prompting you. 

The script will automatically ignore any file with the `__INITIAL` title in it.
